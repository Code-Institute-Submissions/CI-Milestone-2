- **[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)** - standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- **[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)** - used to define styles for Web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** - code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** - provides hosting for software development version control using Git.
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)** - library of free licensed fonts, an interactive web directory for browsing the library, and APIs for conveniently using the fonts via CSS ('_IBM Plex Mono_' monospace font used in this project).

## Testing

For the testing was used following tools:
- **[Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)** - a set web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome.
- **[JSLint](https://jslint.com/)** - a static code analysis tool used for checking if JavaScript source code complies with coding rules
- **[CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)** -service helps to check validity of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
- **[Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)** - helps check the validity of Web documents.

All validation tests passed: no errors in the DevTools console. CSS, HTML and JavaScript have correct syntax as well (no errors found in files during online validation process).

The game navigation is easy and consistent. All links are working and pointing to correct place.

The project was tested across 4 browsers, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Edge, Opera. I used the Dev Tools in browsers to check for compatibility issues on mobile devices. The project looks consistent and responsive on modern smartphones. Project also has been tested on physical devices such as Galaxy A20e and HTC One S.
